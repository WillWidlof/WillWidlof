### Hi there, I'm Will. I'm an Android Developer at Barclays in Manchester, UK at the moment commuting from Widnes. I've worked there 2 years, in that time i've worked on a number of features on the Mobile Banking Android Application. In my spare time I play games, watch the odd show and write apps (and a few other bits and pieces) on here. 
### Recently i've been looking to finish a few app ideas I keep restarting and started experimenting with the JetBrains IntelliJ Plugin SDK. Which has lead to releasing my first plugin attempt ([Spectre Theme](https://github.com/WillWidlof/SpectreTheme)).
