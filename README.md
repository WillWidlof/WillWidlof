### Hi there, I'm Will. I'm an Android Developer at Barclays in Manchester, UK. I've been working there 3 years, in that time i've worked on a number of features on the Mobile Banking Android Application. In my spare time I play games, watch the odd show and write apps (and a few other bits and pieces) on here. 
### Recently i've been looking at picking up Jetpack Compose.
